#summary A gallery with test cases, and the results that Wu's static profiler produces to them.

= Example's Gallery =

In this page we show some examples of programs, and the results that Wu's static profiler produces for them. We use the following keys in the table:

  * *C-Src*: the C program that we have analyzed. This is an actual program, i.e., the very input to the static profiler.
  * *CFG*: the Control Flow Graph (CFG) of the program converted to SSA-form. The numbers on the edges of the CFG are the static probabilities (in a range of 0 to 1) of the branches being taken.
